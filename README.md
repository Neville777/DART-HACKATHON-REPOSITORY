## DART-HACKATHON

This repository contains Dart programs showcasing various concepts such as control flow, functions, and user input handling. Below is a detailed explanation of each program along with instructions on how to run them using Dart.

### Program 1: Functions (`functions.dart`)

This program demonstrates the use of functions in Dart. It implements a simple calculator where the user can input two numbers, and the program performs division and modulus operations on them. The program continues to prompt the user to perform calculations until the user decides to exit by entering 'done'.

#### Running the Program:

To run Program 1, use the following command:

```bash
dart functions.dart
```

Follow the prompts to enter two numbers and perform calculations. Enter 'done' to exit the program.

### Program 2: Control Flow (`controlflow.dart`)

This program showcases the use of control flow statements in Dart to create a grading system. It prompts the user to input marks, and based on the marks, it calculates and assigns a grade. The program continues to prompt the user for marks until the user decides to exit by typing 'exit'.

#### Running the Program:

To run Program 2, use the following command:

```bash
dart controlflow.dart
```

Follow the prompts to enter marks and calculate grades. Type 'exit' to quit the program.

### Program 3: User Information Input (`program1.dart`)

This program demonstrates taking user information input using Dart. It prompts the user to enter their name, age, school, and hobby. It validates the input and displays the collected information in a formatted manner.

#### Running the Program:

To run Program 3, use the following command:

```bash
dart program1.dart
```

Follow the prompts to enter user information. The program will display the collected information once all inputs are provided.
